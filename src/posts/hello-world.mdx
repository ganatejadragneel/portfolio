## How it all started

Back when I was a kid addicted to playing GTA Vice City, I got stuck in a certain mission where we have to 
fly a remote helicopter and do tasks to complete the mission. I kept trying and trying and eventually giving up.
I again tried after a few months and this time i was able to do it in the second try and I started thinking how does
this process works where even a small mishap and we crash the helicopter into the walls which gives me an instant loss.

After completing this game eventually, a dream sprouted in my head to make games in the future which spurred my 
career path going forward to do Computer Science major in college. 

During college in VIT Vellore, I found out about the vast number of fields in this major and dabbled into many such fields such as
 frontend, design, backend, blockchain, cryptography, machine learning, data science, image processing. In the end, I realised I had the most fun working on backend writing logic for applications and creating something new which 
would depend on the logic that I would give the application.

I ended up joining Amazon in the Kindle team where I had to work on the major codebase which handled how the kindle 
software showed the customers how the product should be and what all could be done to make the customer experience 
the best possible to read books.

As an avid book reader, this was very interesting to me, and I enjoyed doing it while working on many kinds of books 
such as fiction, non fiction, comics etc. The userbase of Kindle is all over the world and I had to work on scaling 
the product as much as possible to save resources and keep the product fast. Doing all this, I had a new goal in mind,
I wanted to be an Architect in the future to strategize and build these products.

I later joined Jio where I moved from application development which I used to do in Amazon to API development for the 
customers in India. We had a userbase all over the country for vendors in almost every other area and the scale being
enormous was challenging and gave me a lot of learning.

I have now joined UMass Amherst to enchance my knowledge in the field and grow further in my career.
